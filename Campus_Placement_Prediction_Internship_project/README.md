## Technical aspect
Python 3.7
Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Back-end: Flask framework
IDE: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm
Deployment: Horeku

# How to run this app?

Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have python installed on your system, click here https://www.python.org/downloads/ to install.

- Create virtual environment: conda create -n myenv python=3.7
- Activate the environment: conda activate myenv
- Install the packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the app: python app.py

# Data Collection

The dataset is collected from Kaggle.

# Model Creation and Evaluation

- Various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine tested.
- Random Forest , SVM , Decision Tree and Logistic regression were given better results.SVM was chosen for the final model training and testing.
- Model performance evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.


# Model Deployment

The final model is deployed on Horeku using Flask framework .
